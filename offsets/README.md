# Offsets

Here I've put up a collection of offset cache files. With these, the terribly unstable kernel dumping can be skipped!  
They are to be placed on your device, at `/etc/cl0ver/offsets.dat`.  

It can be that these files work for devices and iOS versions that aren't listed here, but they could also very well crash your device. If you discover that one of these files works for an unlisted combo, please notify me.

Available offsets:

| Device                                    | iOS   | File                                                                                                      |
